# setfit-integrated-gradients

Hacking SetFit so that it works with integrated gradients. See demo.ipynb for an example.

I wrote this mini-library before SetFit 0.6.0. At the time, there was no SetFitHead class yet, so I had to hack the SetFit class to make it work.

I'm leaving this here for posterity and in case it is useful for further hacking.

## Installation

```
pip install -e . 
```
